                    <p>I am an Information Technology Director with more than 25 yearsâ€™ experience. I specialize in IT Management for small and medium sized organizations, with significant experience working for communications and creative firms. I am well versed in Network Infrastructure, Security and Help Desk operations. I truly enjoy finding solutions to IT challenges. I am currently working to expand my technical capabilities with a Full Stack Web Development program through George Washington University. Stay tuned for updates to the Portfolio section!</p>


                    <p>Prior to becoming an IT professional, I served in the United States Air Force as a Korean Linguist. This afforded me the opportunity to not only serve my country but see a bit more of the world. I was stationed in Korea for 3 years and truly enjoyed the time I spent there.</p>


                    <p>Fun fact: My first home computer connected to my TV and loaded programs using a cassette recorder. How times have changed!</p>

                    <p>My favorite daily read is the <a class="bio-link" href="https://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a> website, a place for anything and everything technology related. Check it out!</p>
